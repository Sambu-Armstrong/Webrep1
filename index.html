        Poverty is defined as a condition in which a person lacks certain socially acceptable items such as money for the minimum standard of living. In addition, it also shows the state in which someone is financially. There are two main levels of poverty: primary poverty and secondary poverty.  Primary poverty is where one has less money to meet basic needs while secondary poverty is where they have just the right amount of money to afford the necessities but end up spending some to cope with work-related stress and end up not meeting ends meet (Seebohm,1901). Kenya has recorded a reduced number of cases of people living below the poverty line. Unfortunately, we still have families struggling to obtain basic needs, health services, and others even dying of starvation (Poverty incidence in Kenya declined significantly, but unlikely to be eradicated by 2030, 2018). In this essay, we will discuss the causes of poverty in Kenya, the effects it has on both people and the environment and point out possible solutions based on our research.
